    // JavaScript has five primitive types :Numbers, String, Boolean,
    // Undefined and Null (although it is still possible to construct, say, a
    // String as on object using the String constructor).

    // If we duplicate any variables holding primitive types, we get two separate
    // variables and so changing one does not affect the other.
    let x = 'hello';
    let y = x;
    x = 'goodbye';
    console.log(x, y);



    // But for non-primitive types (anything other than the five types listed
    // above, including arrays (Objects)), duplication only creates an ADDITIONAL
    // REFERENCE with both references pointing to the same object. Any change to
    // one will affect (the other):
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
    players[3] = 'Dave';
    console.log(players, team);

    // SOME SOLUTIONS FOR ARRAYS: (if this is not what you're after):

    // slice() with no parameters:
    const films = ['Blade Runner', 'Vertigo', 'Persona'];
    const movies = films.slice();
    films[2] = 'The Seventh Seal';
    console.log(films, movies);

    // or spread:
    const films2 = ['Annie Hall', 'Terminator 2', 'Birdman'];
    const movies2 = [...films2];
    films2[2] = 'Amores Perros';
    console.log(films2, movies2);

    // or there's even Array.from(films);



    // In terms of legit objects, we can use Object.assign:
    // First argument is a blank object, Second argument is the object we're
    // filling it with, Third arguement is any changes including new variables
    // if you so wish:
    const dude = {
      name: 'Jeremy',
      footballTeam: 'Chelsea'
    }

    const newDude = Object.assign({}, dude, {name: 'Mark', teeth: 'Shiny white'});
    console.log(dude.name, newDude.name);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
